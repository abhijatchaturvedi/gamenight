## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

### Install

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd gamenight
npm install
```

### Run

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Windows | Double-click `start.bat` or run it in terminal |
| macOS / Linux | `./start.sh` |
| Anywhere | `npm start` |

Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser.

---

## 🌐 Network Play

When the server starts it prints every URL your friends can use:

```
🎮  GameNight is live!

  Local:    http://localhost:3000
  Network:  http://192.168.1.42:3000   ← share this!
  Network:  http://10.0.0.5:3000
```

Anyone on the **same WiFi or LAN** can open the Network URL directly — no setup needed on their end.

The server also advertises itself via **mDNS (Bonjour)**, so on most devices you can use the stable hostname instead:

```
http://gamenight.local:3000
```

> **Tip:** `gamenight.local` works on macOS, iOS, Android, and most Linux desktops out of the box. Windows may need [Bonjour for Windows](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999). If it doesn't resolve, fall back to the IP shown in the terminal.

## ⚙️ Game Settings

The room creator can tune settings in the lobby before the game starts. Everyone else sees the current configuration.

| Game | Configurable |
|------|-------------|
| 🎨 Scribble | Draw time (40–120 s) · Rounds (2–5) · Word choices per turn (2–4) |
| 🔪 Mongolpuri | Discussion time · Voting time |
| ⭕ Tic Tac Toe | Free play · Best of 3 / 5 / 7 |
| 🃏 UNO | No configurable settings — standard rules apply |
| 🧠 Quiz | No configurable settings — 15 questions, 20 seconds each |

---

## 📖 How to Play

Rules are built into the app — click **"How to Play"** on any screen. Here's the quick version:

### 🔪 Mongolpuri
Players are secretly assigned **Killer**, **Doctor**, or **Villager**. Roles are hidden by default — tap your role card to reveal it. Each night, every player confirms they are awake (villagers tap "I'm awake"; killer and doctor choose their target). Once all players have acted, the server waits a random delay then resolves the night. At dawn the village debates during a timed discussion, then votes to eliminate a suspect. Villagers win by voting out the Killer. The Killer wins by reducing the living players to two.

In larger games there may be **multiple Doctors** — roughly one per five players — to keep the game balanced.

### 🃏 UNO
Standard UNO rules. Each player starts with 7 cards. On your turn, play a card that matches the top discard by color or value, or draw one from the deck. Special cards: **Skip** ends the next player's turn, **Reverse** flips direction, **+2** forces the next player to draw two, **Wild** lets you choose the active color, **Wild +4** does the same and forces a four-card draw. First player to empty their hand wins. Your name is displayed in the top-left of the game header.

### 🧠 Quiz
The server fetches 15 questions from the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com) at game start and sorts them easy → medium → hard. While questions are loading, players see a "Fetching questions…" screen; the first question appears automatically once the fetch completes (usually under a second, up to ~6 s if the API rate-limits). Each question shows 4 options and a 20-second countdown. Correct answers score 500–1000 points based on speed. After each question the correct answer is revealed alongside the updated leaderboard. Highest total score after all 15 questions wins. Requires internet access when starting the game.

### 🎨 Scribble
One player draws a secret word on a shared canvas while everyone else types guesses in the chat. Faster correct guesses = more points. The drawer earns bonus points for each correct guesser. Hints appear as time runs low. Roles rotate every turn.

### ⭕ Tic Tac Toe
Classic 3×3 grid. Get three of your symbol in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) to win. X always goes first. Symbols swap each game. In match formats, first to reach the win target takes the match. Supports single-elimination tournaments for groups.
